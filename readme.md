## About This Project

This is a series of Laravel's Eloquent Model Relationship Tests. The aim is to help simplify this type of unit test as it is quite unique and repetitive. There is high likelihood that the tests written for each relationship type here can be modified for most use cases. This project can validly serve as a good reference when writing model relationship tests.
